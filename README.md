PaperLens AI is a multimodal research co-pilot that helps users quickly understand and interact with complex academic papers. It transforms dense research documents (PDFs or URLs) into structured summaries, visual diagrams, audio explanations, and short animated videos. Users can upload papers or paste links, and PaperLens AI automatically extracts insights, explains technical concepts visually, and even generates spoken summaries or short explainer clips. The system connects related research using semantic search, helping users see patterns and relationships between ideas. Essentially, it’s like having a “research lens” that converts text-heavy content into multimodal understanding.

💡 What problem(s) does it solve?

Researchers, students, and professionals often face information overload when dealing with complex, lengthy research papers. Reading, summarizing, and cross-referencing takes significant time. PaperLens AI solves this by automating summarization, visual explanation, and audio/video conversion — helping users grasp insights quickly without reading every line.

🎯 Who’s the target audience?

Researchers, students, data scientists, academic professionals, journalists, and analysts in fields like AI, finance, biotech, and climate science.
